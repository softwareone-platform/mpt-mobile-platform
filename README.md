# SoftwareONE Marketplace Mobile

The mobile companion for [SoftwareONE Marketplace](https://portal.platform.softwareone.com/home) — manage your cloud subscriptions, orders, invoices, and agreements on the go. Built with React Native and Expo for iOS and Android.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Passwordless sign-in** — Email + OTP, no passwords to remember
- **Your whole Marketplace in your pocket** — Orders, subscriptions, agreements, invoices, credit memos, statements, programs, and more
- **Spotlight dashboard** — See what matters at a glance
- **Multi-account switching** — Jump between accounts without signing out
- **Cross-platform** — One codebase, native experience on both iOS and Android

## ⬇️ Getting Started

You'll need **Node.js 20+** and either **Xcode** (iOS) or **Android Studio** (Android).

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mpt-mobile-platform

# Set up environment
cp app/.env.example app/.env
# Fill in Auth0 credentials — grab them from Keeper Vault or ask a teammate

# Install and run
cd app
npm install
npm run ios       # or: npm run android
```

That's it. The app should launch in your simulator.

> **Using private `@swo` packages?** Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth && vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` first.

> **Changed `.env` values?** Clear the Metro cache with `npx expo start --clear`, then rebuild.

## 🚀 Usage

Once running, sign in with your SoftwareONE email. You'll receive a one-time code — enter it and you're in.

From there you can browse your Spotlight dashboard, view and search orders, subscriptions, agreements, invoices, and more — everything you'd find on the [web portal](https://portal.platform.softwareone.com/home), optimized for mobile.

## 📋 Development Scripts

Run from the **repository root**. npm commands run from `app/`.

```bash
# Quick start
./scripts/hot-reload.sh              # Dev server with hot reload (press i/a/r)
./scripts/deploy-ios.sh --verbose    # Full iOS Simulator build + deploy

# Build
npm run ios                          # iOS Simulator
npm run android                      # Android emulator

# Quality
npm test                             # Unit tests
npm run lint                         # Lint check
npm run lint:fix                     # Auto-fix lint errors

# Cleanup
./scripts/cleanup.sh                 # Clean build artifacts
./scripts/cleanup.sh --deep          # Nuclear option (removes node_modules)

# E2E
./scripts/run-local-test.sh --platform ios welcome
./scripts/run-local-test.sh --platform android --build all
```

## 🔄 CI/CD

GitHub Actions handle validation and builds automatically.

| Workflow | Trigger | Duration |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **PR Build** | Pull request to `main` | ~2–5 min |
| **Main CI** | Push to `main` | ~25–35 min |
| **iOS / Android Build** | Auto on `main` + manual | ~15–30 min |
| **TestFlight** | Manual only | ~30–45 min |

Every push to `main` runs lint + tests, then builds iOS and Android artifacts in parallel. TestFlight deployment is manual — see [TestFlight Setup](.github/TESTFLIGHT_SETUP.md) for details.

## 💬 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's the quick version:

1. Branch off `main`: `feature/MPT-XXXX/short-description`
2. Read [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) — it's enforced on every PR
3. Write tests for new code
4. Open a PR with a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) title (e.g., `feat: add biometric login`)
5. Wait for CI to go green (lint, tests, [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=softwareone-pc_mpt-mobile-platform) quality gate)

Found a bug or have an idea? [Open an issue](../../issues) — we'd love to hear from you.
